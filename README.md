My favorite bakery in the area is more than just a place to grab a bite—it's a part of my routine and a little escape from the everyday rush. 
The moment you walk in, you're greeted with the comforting aroma of fresh bread, vanilla, and melted chocolate. 
Their cakes are soft and rich, with just the right amount of sweetness, and the pastries are always crisp on the outside and buttery on the inside.

What I love most is the variety—they have something for every mood, from fluffy muffins and creamy cheesecakes to savory puffs and stuffed buns. 
The staff always greets you with a warm smile, and they even remember your usual order, which makes the experience feel personal and special. 
Whether I’m celebrating something or just treating myself after a long day, this bakery always hits the spot.

This is one of the places to where my memories goes from childhood times. Now that the lake has been fenced and a pavement has been put around. 
The total circumferential distance is around 2.3 kilometres. At evenings the place is a bit crowded with people from all ages from school children to retired persons, congregate and socialise. 
Even small vendors are trying to utilise the scenario to increase the sales around the area and causing great disturbance to the joggers/runners.
The place is ideal for joggers and slow runners during evening up to 5:00 PM after which it becomes a hang out place. With Palm trees doted on one side where the elevation is higher, it is a scenic place to enjoy the evenings.

This famous Siva Vishnu temple in the busy area of Madipakkam has a beautiful pond behind.
The Moola Virat is Omkareshwar and Goddess Amba emerged in the form of Maha Tripura Sundari Devi. Temple has ample space inside to sit, relax and meditate by chanting the name of Lord and feel the positive vibes inside the temple.

This is one of the best temple to visit when you are in this Madipakkam area and the local residents are blessed to find all moorthis along with Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu present under one roof.
